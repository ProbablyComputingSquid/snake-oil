# Snake Oil

**Snake Oil** is a dark and gritty theme intead for the developer who wants a lightweight earthy theme that doesn't burn their eyes out. 
Just like the snake oil salesman of the Wild West, they made sure their project was of the *utmost* quality. Like them, I assure you that Snake-Oil was produced with quality code and graphic design, packing a heavy punch in a small bottle. Snake oil was produced for [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)'s [Tonic](https://tonic.hackclub.com) ysws program.
